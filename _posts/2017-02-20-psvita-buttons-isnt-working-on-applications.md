# First, think about what you're doing, do it calm and focused. If you've warranty just send it.


Recently, My Playstation Vita stop working as expected. I was searching all the internet for any way to fix what looks like a software (firmware) problem. Basically, square, circle, left buttons won't work for any reason, BUT only in applications, if I hold ps button to open enable/disable wifi page everything works fine.

First, I found this on EU PSN community:

[PS Vita buttons not working (EU PSN Community)](http://community.eu.playstation.com/t5/PS-Vita-Support/ps-vita-buttons-not-working/m-p/17605424)

It leads me to the first thing to do: go to safe mode and try every option there.

> turn off the psvita, so press power while holding the PS Button and the right shoulder button (Safe mode)

It can't help me in any way and now I was thinking in throw psv away when I found **@mikmoe** first comment:

> Hey guys I also came across this error with my vita buttons only working on the menu and not an actual game. Unlike most I refuse to pay 150$ to send it in and then wait a month to get a new one. So i took it apart and found the problem and its a easy and cheap fix. [...]

Read entire comment if you want to understand what he's explaining.
This comment made me doubt my firmware tesis and I was thinking about something on hardware (it's really odd, because the buttons is working outside apps.)

In minutes I was watching this video:

[Sony Playstation Vita Self Repair Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWpeZVH1DXw&feature=youtu.be)

It's a how to take apart your playstation vita. Now I can f*ck up my psvita myself. I bought a precision screwdriver and start disassembly it.

If you're reading this now and thinking: "ow, f*ck... I can't do this." there's something you need to know: it's REALLY easy. (remember, do it calm and focused, if you prefer write where every screw goes or take a photo of every step)

All you need to do is follow the video until when he remove the left and right boards, there's our problem (or should be), you don't need to open entire thing. I just remove the left and right boards (after remove all the screws and flat cables) and clean up both connections using alcohol.

Now you can mount it, go to safe mode, recreate database, wait a little, pray a little.

My PS Vita come back to work flawlessly after that, I hope you can ressurect yours too.

Special thanks to ps player @mikmoe.
