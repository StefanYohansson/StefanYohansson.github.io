Hi, (it's a short one)

Recently, I have created a theme for AMOR project, since I finish it I have found another way to install themes without compile it.

We only need to put the theme on `~/.kde4/share/apps/amor` folder.

Steps:

* [Download theme here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwFhcg1_acLiWG9wQW8wQl9HSGc?usp=sharing)
* `cd ~/.kde4/share/apps/amor`
* `mv <where-you-downloaded-file.zip> .`
* `unzip <file.zip>`
* Open `amor`
* Right-click on your current character > Configure > Choose installed theme
* Apply

All set, enjoy it!
